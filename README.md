# ShareYourLinks

This application is used as a demo for the Python course taught to
second year bachelor students. It allows to manage a list of links
with a title, a URL and a description. Users can vote for the links.


## Dependencies

- cherrypy (8.1.2)
- jinja2 (2.8)


## Quick start

To run the server, just launch:

    > ./server.py

You can then access the website on http://localhost:8080:

After having launched the server, you can launch the GUI:

    > ./admin.py

You can then examine the links and delete them:
